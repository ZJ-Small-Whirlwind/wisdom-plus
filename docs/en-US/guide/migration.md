## Vue 3 migration build

You may encounter some issues when using ElementPlus with Vue 3 migration build. Some of the components rely on Vue 3 internal API's. It's worth trying to adjust compatConfig mode to 3, either globally or [per component in your project](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/migration-build.html#per-component-config).
